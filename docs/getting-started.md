## Installation

### Docker

TBD

### Binaries

TBD

### Source code

The source code is hosted at https://github.com/owncloud/web
Please refer to the [build documentation for Web]({{< ref "building.md" >}}).

## Configuration

Depending on the backend you are using, there are sample config files provided in the [ownCloud Web](https://github.com/owncloud/web) git repository.
Please refer to the configuration details below.

#### Options
- `options.hideSearchBar` Lets you hide the search bar at the top of the screen for all users.
- `options.homeFolder` You can specify a folder that is used when the user navigates `home`. Navigating home gets triggered by clicking on the `All files` 
menu item. The user will not be jailed in that directory. It simply serves as a default location. You can either provide a static location, or you can use 
variables of the user object to come up with a user specific home path. This uses twig template variable style and allows you to pick a value or a 
substring of a value of the authenticated user. Examples are `/Shares`, `/{{.Id}}` and `/{{substr 0 3 .Id}}/{{.Id}`.

## Setting up backend and running

Web can run against either [ownCloud 10](https://github.com/owncloud/core/) as backend or [OCIS](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis).
Depending which one you chose, please check the matching section:

- [Setting up with ownCloud as backend]({{< ref "backend-oc10.md" >}})
- [Setting up with OCIS as backend]({{< ref "backend-ocis.md" >}})

## Running

- [Running with ownCloud as backend]({{< ref "backend-oc10.md#running-web" >}})
- [Running with OCIS as backend]({{< ref "backend-ocis.md#running-web" >}})
